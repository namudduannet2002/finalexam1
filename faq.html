   <h4> How do I place an order?</h4>
    <h6>Ordering your first GAK is really easy. Just follow these steps:</h6>
    
 <p>   (1) Go to the "Manage payment methods" section in your profile and add a debit/credit  <br>
    (2) Go back to the main screen and set the delivery address.<br> Remember to choose the correct city from the drop-down menu.<br>
    If you have a promo code, don't forget to validate it in your profile before ordering.
</p>
    <h5>Now you have 3 options:</h5>
   <p> (1) Buy something: from a restaurant or store. Choose from any of our partners in any of the categories.<br>
    (2) Send something: with just a pick-up point and destination, you can use a courier to send anything.<br>
    (3) Ask for something (Anything): describe anything you need and GAK will try to make it happen!<br>
    Follow the steps required for each option and once you’re finished, a courier will accept your order and deliver it in minutes.<br>
    If you need to add more than one delivery address, you'll need to place the order on our website, gak.com.<br>
</p>
   <h5> How much does delivery cost?</h5>
   <p> The price of our service is optimised by distance, so the closer it is, the cheaper it is.
